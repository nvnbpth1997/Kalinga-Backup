.Net Core ----
cross platform
inbuilt dependancy injection
uses json hence faster
appsettings.json is webconfig files
entity framework core sqlserver must be used
core cors must be used

Using Entity framework in core:-
register the dbcontext in Startup --> configure services method
appsettings has json for connection string
register the interface-class pairs
	transient creates instance every time
	scoped creates instance per http request
	singleton creates instance for application

AddCors must be registered inside configureServices()
