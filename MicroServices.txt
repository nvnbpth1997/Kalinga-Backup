.UseIISIntegration()
It is crosss platform 
Uses inbuilt DI
	- object is not created by us. instead it is injected when the controller is invoked
	- use fromservices attribute to do method DI

main method in program.cs invoked first (similar to global.asax in framework)
startup method creates object for us
use configureservices method to register the controllers
app setting.json is same like app.config
